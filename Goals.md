My primary goal is to implement a pathfinding algorithm for enemy AI that primarily exists and traverses an aerial space but also has the ability to land on platforms/floating islands

My secondary goal is to find and implement a more complex and creative way to use the Algorithms we’ve been covering to the enemy AI. 
Assuming that I’m able to come up with and implement a creative way of using an algorithm for my enemy Ai, it’s also a subgoal to a) make the performance of the code as solid as possible, and b) make the functions as bug-free as possible.
